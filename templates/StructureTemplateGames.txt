  - If 0 top providers are missing (casino has all 13): This is very rare and exceptional. Commend the casino highly for this achievement.

  - If 1-2 top providers are missing: This is still pretty good.

* When commenting focus on benefits or drawbacks for the reader. For every benefit you mention, explain why this benefit should matter to the reader and provide an example. Use short sentences, maximum 20 words per sentence.

## Q: Does [casino] have Originals or provably fair games?

* If the casino has in-house games (Originals), state this and commend the casino on this by stating how in-house games can benefit the reader (for example, with in-house games the casino shows preparedness to go the extra mile to offer their players something new and unique, in-house games are usually modern, fast-paced games, where casinos can even offer exclusive in-house promotions in, making for a much more diverse and unique user experience, etc.). For every benefit you mention, explain why this benefit should matter to the reader and provide an example. Use short sentences, maximum 20 words per sentence.
* If the casino has provably fair games, mention this briefly. Explain the benefit of provably fair games to the reader.
* If the casino has neither in-house games nor provably fair games, you can briefly mention this, but keep it neutral and short.

## Q: Can I search for games based on RTP or volatility?

* ONLY answer this question if the casino allows you to search for games based on RTP or volatility.

* If game filters are not working properly, warn the reader about it and explain what exactly is the problem and how that can be a drawback. Offer another brand as an alternative that has all game filters working properly, taken from the Top Casinos with properly working filters.
* If the casino does not have RTP or volatility filters and filters work fine - DO NOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION. Skip it entirely.
