## Q&A Format: Manual Comment Integration Logic

This guide explains how to intelligently integrate manual comments into the Q&A review format.

### Core Principle:
Manual comments must EITHER be integrated into existing Q&A pairs OR form new Q&A pairs. Never leave comments unaddressed.

### Step-by-Step Process:

**STEP 1: Analyze Each Manual Comment**
For each manual comment provided, identify:
- What feature/topic is it discussing?
- What specific information does it provide?
- Is this information critical to include?

**STEP 2: Check for Existing Question Match**
Review all the pre-defined questions in the section template and ask:
- Does any existing question already cover this feature/topic?
- Would this comment naturally fit as additional information in an existing answer?

Examples of matches:
- Comment about "VPN works but slow" → Matches existing Q: "Can I use a VPN to play in [casino]?"
- Comment about "KYC took 3 days for me" → Matches existing Q: "How long can KYC reviews take?"
- Comment about "They have 15 exclusive slots" → Matches existing Q: "Does [casino] have Originals or provably fair games?"

**STEP 3a: If Match Found - Integrate into Existing Answer**
- Add the comment information to the relevant existing question's answer
- Maintain the answer's existing structure and flow
- Incorporate the new information naturally without disrupting the answer
- Keep the original answer content and ADD the new information from the comment
- Make sure the added information is clearly stated with all details from the comment

Example:
Existing Q&A:
Q: Can I use a VPN to play in [casino]?
A: Yes, [casino] is VPN friendly, which means you can access it from restricted regions...

After adding comment "VPN works but connection drops sometimes":
Q: Can I use a VPN to play in [casino]?
A: Yes, [casino] is VPN friendly, which means you can access it from restricted regions. However, I noticed that VPN connections can drop occasionally, which might interrupt your gaming session.

**STEP 3b: If No Match Found - Create New Q&A Pair**
- Formulate a clear, specific question based on the comment topic
- Write a complete answer using all information from the comment
- Follow the same question format as other questions in that section
- Place the new Q&A pair under the "+ questions/answers from manual comments" section
- Ensure the question is phrased as it would be asked by a user

Question Formulation Guidelines:
- Use the same format as existing questions: "Does [casino]...", "Can I...", "How...", "What..."
- Make questions specific and clear
- Avoid yes/no questions unless they lead to detailed answers

Example comment → Q&A conversion:

Comment: "The casino offers a unique cashback program that gives 10% daily cashback on losses, no wagering required."

New Q&A:
Q: Does [casino] offer any unique loyalty or cashback programs?
A: Yes, [casino] offers a daily cashback program that returns 10% of your losses with no wagering requirements. This is quite player-friendly since you get real money back without having to meet any playthrough conditions.

Comment: "Customer support replies in German and English only, no other languages available."

New Q&A:
Q: What languages does [casino] customer support handle?
A: [Casino] customer support operates in German and English only. If you need assistance in other languages, you might face communication barriers. This is more limited than many international casinos that support 5+ languages.

**STEP 4: Categorization Rules**
Place new Q&A pairs in the appropriate section based on topic:
- **General**: Overall experience, VPN, reputation, support languages, website issues, regional restrictions
- **Payments**: Deposit/withdrawal methods, processing times, limits, fees, KYC, payment issues
- **Games**: Game selection, specific games, game features, providers, performance issues
- **Responsible Gambling**: Limits, tools, self-exclusion, account controls
- **Bonuses**: Any promotional offers, bonus terms, wagering, restrictions

**STEP 5: Quality Checks**
Before finalizing, verify:
- ✓ All manual comments have been addressed (either integrated or converted to new Q&A)
- ✓ No duplicate information across different Q&A pairs
- ✓ New questions follow the same format and style as existing questions
- ✓ All specific details from comments are included (numbers, names, exact mechanisms)
- ✓ Answers maintain the conversational, analytical tone consistent with the guidelines

### Special Cases:

**Multiple Comments About Same Topic:**
If you have multiple comments about the same feature:
- Combine them into one comprehensive answer
- OR add them as separate points within the same answer
- Do NOT create multiple Q&A pairs for the same topic

**Conflicting Comments:**
If a comment conflicts with existing data:
- Prioritize the manual comment (it's more recent/specific)
- Mention both perspectives if appropriate
- Example: "While the casino states X, in practice I found Y..."

**Vague Comments:**
If a comment is unclear:
- Do your best to interpret the intent
- Focus on the factual information provided
- If you cannot create a meaningful Q&A, integrate it into the most relevant existing answer

### Format for Manual Comment Section:

At the end of each section template, you'll see:
```
## + questions/answers from manual comments
* Include any additional [section] questions and answers provided in the manual comments section.
```

This is where you should place NEW Q&A pairs created from comments that don't match existing questions.

Format:
```
## Q: [Your formulated question]?

[Your complete answer based on the comment information]

## Q: [Next formulated question if applicable]?

[Next answer]
```

### CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- NEVER summarize or condense comment information - include ALL details
- NEVER skip manual comments - they MUST all be addressed
- ALWAYS maintain first-person perspective ("I") and address reader as "you"
- ALWAYS bold key features mentioned in comments
- ALWAYS include specific numbers, names, and mechanisms from comments
- NEVER add information not in the comment or existing data
