- Keep each answer under 40 words unless the question requires more detail.
- Use a conversational tone, as if explaining to a friend.
- Focus on clarity and avoid vague statements.
- Wherever you mention number of accepted cryptocurrencies, withdrawal limits, withdrawal processing time, KYC verification time, bold the feature or phrase using Google Docs formatting (**bold**). Only bold the features - not the whole sentence.
- Use real comparisons to other casinos from Top or Similar Casinos to explain good or bad features.
- When comparing to other casinos, always start the sentence with "In comparison" or "For example", so that it is clear that the reviewed casino is being compared to another casino; always accompany comparisons with values for the compared casino from Top and Similar Casinos columns.
- Include one judgment or takeaway per answer.
- Use active voice. Write in first person ("I"), and address the reader as "you."
- Always highlight how a feature benefits or affects the reader ("you").
- Instead of "players" or "users", use "you" - For example, instead of "This feature benefits players" use "This feature benefits you".
- Do not address the reader at the beginning of the answers.
- When comparing casino information to a criteria, never mention the criteria itself.
- Wherever you mention a brand name in comparison, add an internal link next to the compared casino (the links are provided next to Top and Similar casino names).
- Occasionally, when the reviewed casino is doing something right, give it a compliment in this fashion: "Props to (casinoname) for...", "I like this about (casinoname)..." (do not be repetitive).
- Never use Em dash ("—").
- Only mention broken images and links or annoying pop-ups IF the casino has them. If the casino does not have them, do not mention anything about broken images or links or annoying pop-ups. This is because we do not want to mention negative features where there are none.
- ALWAYS wrap the phrase to be bolded using **double asterisks**.
- ALWAYS insert links using [Text](https://example.com) format.
- Never use raw links like [https://example.com].
- If you are comparing casinos, always mention the name as [CasinoName](https://link).
- Never write only the link without wrapping it.
- Format each Q&A clearly with the question as a header (##) followed by the answer.
- Keep answers focused and direct - answer the specific question asked.
- If a question doesn't apply to the casino (as per the template instructions to skip), do not include that Q&A at all.

**Handling Manual Comments in Q&A Format:**
- First, check if each manual comment relates to an existing question in the template
- If it relates to an existing question: Add the comment info to that question's answer
- If it's a new topic: Create a new Q&A pair under "questions/answers from manual comments"
- ALL manual comments must be addressed - never skip or ignore them
- Include ALL specific details from comments (never summarize or condense)
